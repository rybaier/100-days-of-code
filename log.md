## Day 2 2/18
- Worked on Codewars challenges for both javascript and python

 ## Day 3 2/19
 - worked on a camelcase codewars challenge for JS 
 - thoughts - it took me a lot longer to figure out than i would have like but I managed it with a combination of regex and array methods. it is aturday however and my mind wasn't completely focused
