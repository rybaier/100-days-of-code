# 100 days of code Log
This is my log after comiting to 100 days of code. I am 1 month from finishing my SoftwareEngineering Bootcamp course and am ecstatic to see what I will have completed at the end of this 100 days though I know some days are going to be frustrating! The goal is continue learning and continue growing my knowledge and skills in development

## Day 1 February 17 2021
Worked on quiz answer randomization and answer functionality after some research found a very helpful code example on stack overflow that described the Shwartzian transform in js

## Day 2 2/18
- Worked on Codewars challenges for both javascript and python
 - thoughts: while the syntax is similiar I am finding it difficult to switch back and forth for each challenge

 ## Day 3 2/19
 - worked on a camelcase codewars challenge for JS 
 - thoughts - it took me a lot longer to figure out than i would have like but I managed it with a combination of regex and array methods. it is aturday however and my mind wasn't completely focused
 the code is in my jsplayground directory in this repo
