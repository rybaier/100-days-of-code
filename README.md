# 100 days of code Log
This is my log after comiting to 100 days of code. I am 1 month from finishing my SoftwareEngineering Bootcamp course and am ecstatic to see what I will have completed at the end of this 100 days though I know some days are going to be frustrating! The goal is continue learning and continue growing my knowledge and skills in development

## Day 1 February 17 2021
Worked on quiz answer randomization and answer functionality after some research found a very helpful code example on stack overflow that described the Shwartzian transform in js

## Day 2 2/18
- Worked on Codewars challenges for both javascript and python
 - thoughts: while the syntax is similiar I am finding it difficult to switch back and forth for each challenge

 ## Day 3 2/19
 - worked on a camelcase codewars challenge for JS 
 - thoughts - it took me a lot longer to figure out than i would have like but I managed it with a combination of regex and array methods. it is aturday however and my mind wasn't completely focused
 the code is in my jsplayground directory in this repo

## Day 4 2/20
- wordked on codewars challenge for Python for a while then to make myself feel better I started working on a backend for my LOTR-toilet-time project
- thoughts: the kata I worked on has thrown me for a loop I am finding it hard to switch to python as I do not know any of the syntax and the regex kata is difficult currently. I will overcome it but damn is it frustrating. After solving the Kata on codewars I moved on to making a backend for a previous react api project i made earlier in the course. The kata code is in the python_playground.py in this repo
    - I gave my self timer wanted to see how far I could get in 30 min. I will continue to use a 30 min timer to manage building the backend for my LOTR-toilet-time project
